## Step 1: 3D Printing

Print the all the parts required from the following link: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3460326 

## Step 2: Minikame Assembly

Refer to the following link to assemble your Minikame Mk2 Qadruped: https://www.instructables.com/id/Ez-Arduino-MiniKame-Mk2-Making-a-8-DOF-3D-Print-Qu/

## Step 3: Arm Assembly

### 3.1: Start by mounting the Arm Base piece onto the Body Top of the quadruped

### 3.2: Attach a servo to the Arm Base.

### 3.3: Mount the Arm Piece on to the servo you just installed. Attach the servo head too!

### 3.4: Now, install a servo on the piece

### 3.5: Install the Arm front piece on the servo

### 3.6: Attach another servo

### 3.7 Attach the claw Piece

### 3.8 Follow these instruction. It's okay if the claw piece DOES NOT match your piece
 
1) Attach the servo to the claw support using the two fixing screws supplied with the servo. Keep the output shaft forward

2) Insert the horn in the driven gear then attach the horn at the servo shaft using the supplied screw. The horn has to be aligned forward with the servo in neutral position. Cut the exceeding part of the horn from gear using a cutter

3) Insert an M3 screw in the central hole connect it to the claw support then tight the self locking nut checking the freedom of movement

4) Insert the two pin of the driven gear into the dedicated holes on the left finger The driven gear has also a shoulder that has to be aligned with the lateral side of the finger. If you find difficulties coupling them, reduce interference using a file.

Once coupled insert an M3 screw in the central hole and attach the finger to the claw support

Direction: You might have to change a little of the code by adding in the method in the loop method to do the specific thing that you want it to do
